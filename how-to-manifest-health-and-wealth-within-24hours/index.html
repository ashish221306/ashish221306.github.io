                    <p class="text-muted lead">I’d like you to imagine a garden.

                        In this garden, the soil is always rich with nutrients and what you plant, it will grow. There
                        is rain and sun so you don’t have to worry about anything.

                        You can plant anything. There are no restrictions.

                        You can plant roses or you can plant poison ivy. You can plant tomatoes or you can plant
                        nightshade, a deadly poison. What you put in, as a seed, will eventually grow into something
                        much bigger.

                        This garden is your mind and the seeds you can plant are your thoughts.

                        Your mind is a fertile place where the thoughts you plant, will grow and make up for what your
                        life is.

                        Or as the old passage from the Bible goes, from the book of proverbs, chapter 23, verse 7:</p>
                    <h3 class="heading-blacl">“As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,".
                    </h3>
                    <p class="lead py-3 text-muted">
                        Your thoughts, your convictions, manifest the surrounding reality.

                        Your life, good or bad, is nothing more than a reflection of the thoughts you’ve planted in your
                        mind and nourished. These thoughts became behaviors. Behaviors became results.

                        You are where you are right now because deep down in your heart, this is where you wanted to be,
                        no matter how sad or unfair this may sound.

                        This principle is one of the oldest spiritual laws in existence. It’s also one of the best
                        known. You may know it under a different term.

                        This is “you become what you think about”.

                        And you can find this in all of world’s religions.

                        Some variation of this exists in Hinduism, in Christianity and in basically every other major
                        religion. It’s found in all belief systems, as the one used by the Chinese. It’s as much of a
                        universal law as gravity. Long before books existed, wise people understood that our thoughts
                        manifest our reality.

                        It works on two levels.

                        First, your beliefs are connected to the universe on a quantum level. We manifest what we really
                        believe.

                        Let me make this clear though.

                        You don’t manifest what you think you believe. You manifest what’s in your heart. If you believe
                        you deserve unhappiness and pain, then no matter what you say, this you’ll get.

                        A great deal of people believe they have positive thoughts when their inner voice is always
                        negative and destructive.

                        That voice will always win. Maybe this is why LoA fails for so many people - they’re trying to
                        grow trees of prosperity and success while planting seeds of doubt and pain and suffering.

                        It doesn’t work this way.

                        You get what’s in your heart. The universe will manifest it. But what’s in your heart is the
                        truth and we may not always know of this truth.

                        Life doesn’t give you what you intended.

                        Life gives you what you ask.

                        And while many people intend for wealth and joy and health, their thoughts are of poverty and
                        sadness and despair. Since this is what they’re planting, this is what the universe is
                        manifesting.

                        Second, your thoughts lead to beliefs.

                        Your beliefs lead to actions.

                        Your actions lead to outcomes.

                        Your outcomes leads to your destiny.

                        The thoughts you plant in your mind will determine how you act, on a level that’s so subtle that
                        you can’t even perceive it. Who you are, is the consequence of the thoughts you’ve adopted.

                        It’s hard to realize this.

                        It’s on the same level of breathing.

                        You realize your breath only if you pay attention. You realize your behavior and where it comes
                        from only if you analyze it. But everything you are comes from the thoughts you’ve once planted
                        in your mind and then let them become a part of you.

                        So when you plant positive thoughts, you get positive results.

                        When you plant love and happiness, your behavior will reflect love and it will create happiness
                        for yourself and for others.

                        When you plant thoughts of prosperity and wealth, your behavior will create wealth and
                        prosperity in the world.

                        Think of this like the captain of an airplane. An airplane is huge, carries hundreds of
                        passengers and weighs tens of tons. Yet, you will find just one or two pilots in the cockpit,
                        controlling this huge machine.

                        So is with your life.

                        Even if your behavior is infinitely complex, there are just a few thoughts that control all of
                        it and if you replace those thoughts, everything will change for you too.

                        The thoughts you plant in it will both manifest reality as in creating reality itself and shape
                        your behavior to create the results you want.

                        Both are important.

                        This world is a 50 - 50 place.

                        The universe can manifest the opportunities you require at this moment but you must act to take
                        advantage. If luck knocks at your door, you still need to open the door.

                        It’s like in this old joke.

                        A fisherman is caught up in a storm. His boat is sinking. Desperate, he prays to God.

                        “God, please save me, I’ll be good, I’ll repent, just save me”

                        A few minutes later, a boat shows up.

                        “Hi there, do you need any help?”, the good Samaritan asks him.

                        “No, no, God will save me”, the fisherman answers.

                        Perplexed, the savior leaves.

                        Ten minutes later, the same things happen. Another boat shows up. They offer to help him. The
                        fisherman refuses saying that God will help him.

                        Eventually, the boat sinks, he dies and goes to heaven. There, face to face with God, he asks …

                        “God, why did you left me to die? I prayed to you and I promised I’ll repent for my sins”.

                        God looks at him and says “What are you talking about? I’ve sent you two boats”.

                        This is a joke, but this is how life works too.

                        We manifest opportunities but you must take advantage of these opportunities. If you are a real
                        estate agent and you want to close a huge deal, your thoughts will manifest this opportunity.
                        The universe will align the people, places and circumstances for this to happen.

                        But these people, places and circumstances won’t come to you in your living room. You must still
                        act and do something.

                        Or maybe you want to find the love of your life.

                        Thoughts of love and appreciation will manifest your ideal partner but your partner won’t knock
                        at the door and ask you for a date.

                        The universe is like a tree that offers you the fruits you need, in infinite abundance, but you
                        still must grab those fruits from the tree.

                        And it all starts with your thoughts, with your beliefs.

                        Make a commitment now to fill your mind with positive thoughts. Make a commitment to think only
                        thoughts of love and joy and wealth.

                        At first, it will be hard.

                        If you’re used to plant only poison in your mind, it will take a while until you take it all
                        out. But once you do, you’ll notice something incredible happening. You’ll see how you’ll walk
                        into the right circumstances. You’ll find yourself in the right places, at the right time, to
                        get what you want.
